# How To Contribute

We are really glad you're reading this. Please reach out for specific questions. 

## Suggesting Changes
If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/sanjanakrishnan/covid-19-dashboard/issues/new)! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

## Submitting Changes

If you wish to create your own dashboard feel free to fork the repository. If you wish to add to the repository then fork [Pune-COVID dashboard](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and create a branch with a descriptive name. 

A good branch name would be (where issue #42 is the ticket you're working on):
```
git checkout -b 42-added-covid-data-for-timbuktu
```

Please send us a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/sanjanakrishnan/covid-19-dashboard/compare)  with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding Conventions
Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. It is pretty straightforward:

> - This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. Please add readable and understandable comments.


## Get the style right

If you wish to add a feature, your patch should follow the same conventions & pass the same code quality checks as the rest of the project.
